Cooking Together
----------------

My new version of my cooking website.

# Tech

I'm using Jekyll to build the website.
And `nix` as my package manager.
I'm also using nix flakes as an experiment,
mostly based on [this very nix blog](https://xeiaso.net/blog/nix-flakes-1-2022-02-21).

So to serve do:

```bash
nix develop
bundle exec jekyll serve
```
